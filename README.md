# S-1-equivariant-symplectic-capacites-for-toric-domains

## Initial commit: 

For dynamically convex pseudo-rotations it can be shown from a result of Ginzburg-Gurel that there is a subsequence of equivariant capacities whose consecutive differences converges to 0. We believe these differences relate to C0-rigidity of Reeb flow on contact 3d-manifolds.

Here we show computationally using Gutt-Hutchings capacities that toric domains (other than ellipsoids) are counter-examples to above phenomenum. While convex toric domains are dynamically convex, ellipsoids are only examples of pseudo-rotations. This suggests these differences converges to zero if and only if the Reeb flow is a pseudo-rotation.

## In further commits:

We will explore concave toric domains and explore computational estimate of the above difference.
